Phase 1: Information Gathering
On Windows Command Prompt (cmd or PowerShell):
cmd# Check Windows proxy settings
netsh winhttp show proxy

# Check network adapters
ipconfig /all

# Check DNS
nslookup google.com

# Test connectivity
ping google.com
Inside WSL (run wsl then these commands):
bash# Check network configuration
ip addr show
ip route show
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Check proxy environment variables
env | grep -i proxy

# Test basic connectivity
ping 8.8.8.8
ping google.com
nslookup google.com

# Check if WSL can reach Windows host
ping $(ip route | grep default | awk '{print $3}')

# Check current shell and profile files
echo $SHELL
ls -la ~/.bashrc ~/.profile /etc/environment
Docker Desktop Check (Windows):
cmd# Check Docker network settings
docker network ls
docker info
Phase 2: What I Need to Know
Please run all the above commands and share the output. I particularly need to know:

Windows proxy configuration - does it show webproxy.bns:8080?
WSL network setup - can WSL reach the Windows host?
DNS resolution - is it working in both Windows and WSL?
Current proxy settings in WSL - are there any proxy environment variables set?

Questions for Clarification:

Do you need to be connected to Cisco VPN for normal work, or does internet work on Windows without VPN?
When you say "none of internet works" in WSL - does this mean you can't ping anything, or specifically can't use apt/package managers?
Are you able to access internal company resources from WSL, or is it completely isolated?

Once I have this information, I can provide specific configuration steps for WSL proxy settings and network configuration.
Where to run what:

Windows commands: Run in Command Prompt or PowerShell (not inside WSL)
WSL commands: First type wsl to enter Linux environment, then run the bash commands
Make sure to specify which environment you're running each command in when sharing results

Please share the outputs and I'll help you get WSL internet connectivity working!
