The Full Chain:
Container Firefox → Container hosts file → Container socat → RHEL VM socat → Real Claude
Step 1: Dockerfile with custom setup
dockerfileFROM ubuntu:latest

# Install Firefox, socat, and basic tools
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    firefox \
    socat \
    x11vnc \
    xvfb \
    fluxbox \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Custom hosts file - redirect claude.ai to localhost
RUN echo "127.0.0.2 claude.ai" >> /etc/hosts
RUN echo "127.0.0.2 api.anthropic.com" >> /etc/hosts

# Start script
COPY start.sh /start.sh
RUN chmod +x /start.sh

EXPOSE 5901 6901
CMD ["/start.sh"]
Step 2: Container startup script (start.sh)
bash#!/bin/bash
# Start socat proxy - route localhost:443 to RHEL VM
socat TCP4-LISTEN:443,bind=127.0.0.2,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:RHEL_VM_IP:8443 &

# Start VNC and Firefox
Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
x11vnc -display :1 -nopw -listen localhost -xkb &
DISPLAY=:1 firefox &
wait
Step 3: RHEL VM socat
bash# On RHEL VM - proxy to real Claude
socat TCP4-LISTEN:8443,fork,reuseaddr TCP4:claude.ai:443
Step 4: Build and run
bash# On Windows
docker build -t claude-proxy-browser .
docker run -p 5901:5901 --name claude-browser claude-proxy-browser
This creates a perfect tunnel that completely bypasses corporate restrictions!
Want me to help you create these files?RetrySfirst how do. i access the firefox whic hstarted in container? will there be any ui or something like that? or d o i ge ta rdp like window for that container in my laptop?EditGreat question! You need a way to see and interact with the Firefox browser running inside the container. Here are the options:
Option 1: VNC (Most Common)
The container runs a VNC server, you connect with VNC client:
Container setup:
dockerfile# Container runs VNC server on port 5901
EXPOSE 5901
Access from Windows:

Install TightVNC Viewer or RealVNC Viewer
Connect to: localhost:5901
You'll see a desktop with Firefox running

Option 2: Web-based VNC (Easiest)
Container serves VNC through a web page:
Container setup:
dockerfile# Container runs web VNC on port 6901
EXPOSE 6901
Access from Windows:

Open Chrome/Edge to: http://localhost:6901
You'll see Firefox in your browser (like remote desktop)

Option 3: X11 Forwarding (Advanced)
Direct display forwarding to Windows X server.
Recommended: Web VNC
bash# Use this pre-built image with web VNC
docker run -d -p 6901:6901 --name firefox-test \
  consol/ubuntu-xfce-vnc:latest
Then go to: http://localhost:6901/?password=vncpassword
You'll see:

A full Linux desktop in your browser
Firefox icon to click
Mouse and keyboard work normally
Looks like remote desktop in a browser tab

Want to try the simple web VNC approach first?
